# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

A Loan Eligibility Prediction project using machine learning involves developing a model that can assess
whether an individual is eligible for a loan based on various features or attributes.

The goal is to create a predictive model that automates the decision-making process.

In this project we use Decision tree & Na√Øve Bayes model to get better accuracy.
